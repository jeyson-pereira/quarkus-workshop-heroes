== Instructions

There are several workshops available that you can follow depending your needs:

* _Develop the Super Heroes with Quarkus_:
  If you are a developer, are new to quarkus, then this workshop might interest you.
  You will develop, from scratch, a set of microservices accessing databases, Kafka channels and exposing APIs.
  Check https://quarkus.io/quarkus-workshops/super-heroes/index.html to get the workshop instructions.
* _Deploy the Super Heroes to Azure Container Apps_:
  If you are interested in deploying an already made application to Azure Container Apps, then this workshop is for you.
  You will not develop any Quarkus (you don't even need Java tools), but you will be pushing Docker containers, creating managed services on Azure (databases, Kafka) and monitoring the entire system (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/events/jdconf-2022/quarkus-superheroes-on-azure[watch a video presenting the workshop]).
  Check https://quarkus.io/quarkus-workshops/super-heroes/index-azure.html to get the workshop instructions.

== Start the infrastructure

This workshop requires a couple of extra _technical_ services (databases, kafka...).
Start them using the `docker-compose.yaml` file located in the `infrastructure` directory:

```
$ cd infrastructure
$ docker compose up
```

Stop them using:

```
CTRL+C
$ docker compose down
$ docker compose rm
```

== Build

To build the entire code, you need to run the following commands from the root project (also see how we activate the `complete` profile):

```bash
$ mvn clean install -f super-heroes/extension-version
$ mvn clean install -Pcomplete
```

== Running the complete system

* Run the infrastructure and build the complete system as explained above.
* In a new terminal, run the heroes microservice
```bash
$ cd rest-heroes
$ mvn clean compile quarkus:dev
```
* In a new terminal, run the villains microservice
```bash
$ cd rest-villains
$ mvn clean compile quarkus:dev
```
* In a new terminal, run the fights microservice
```bash
$ cd rest-fights
$ mvn clean compile quarkus:dev
```
* In a new terminal, run the fights microservice
```bash
$ cd event-statistics
$ mvn clean compile quarkus:dev
```
